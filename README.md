# MlnCommander: Your file manager to increment your limits

<img src="/images/banner.jpg" alt="Main banner" width="100%" height="auto">

MlnCommander is a dual-window file explorer that uses hotkeys to perform actions and save time from tedious double-clicking. It offers customizable colors and directory options. You can copy, move, create directories, create office files, and duplicate the current directory in the other explorer.

## Motivation

This started as a project to learn Python. Then, I searched for a native graphical environment for Linux and found Gtk. I realized I could adapt it to my needs, since despite excellent similar programs, I had specific needs, such as image previews.
